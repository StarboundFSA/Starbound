            In addition to using your vision, it's also important to rely on
            your hearing to stay safe during space travel. While the vacuum of
            space itself is silent, you'll still need to be able to hear the
            sounds of your spacecraft, equipment, and communications from
            mission control. Make sure to wear any necessary hearing protection
            to prevent hearing damage, but also keep your ears alert for any
            unexpected or abnormal sounds that could indicate a potential
            problem. Remember to communicate any concerns with your team and
            stay vigilant at all times.
